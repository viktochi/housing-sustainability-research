Title: The Sustainability of Affordable Housing in San Francisco
Research Scope:
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) initiated a series of measures
during the 1970s in response to mounting criticisms regarding the role of assisted housing
projects in perpetuating residential segregation. A seminal study titled "Assisted Housing and
Residential Segregation" (Rohe & Freeman, 2001) sought to assess the efficacy of these
measures by scrutinizing the influence of race and ethnicity in the development of assisted
housing during the 1980s. The study revealed that despite HUD's concerted efforts, indicators
such as poverty rates and minority concentration continued to exert a significant influence on
the planning and execution of certain categories of assisted housing projects.
It is imperative to delve deeper into the disparities inherent in the realm of affordable housing
initiatives. Diverse programs exist, encompassing project-based affordable housing projects and
market-rate housing developments, with a fundamental determinant of "affordability" being the
underlying property valuation associated with apartment complexes. Notably, more economically
accessible housing options may not always find placement within the most sustainable
communities, potentially leading to an escalation in vehicular travel, among other
consequences. A comprehensive examination of affordable housing projects within the context
of Chicago (Talen & Koschinsky, 2010) revealed that, on average, affordable housing projects
were situated in communities characterized by enhanced sustainability attributes, including
heightened walkability and accessibility. However, it is essential to underscore that certain
programmatic categories did not conform to this pattern.
Our collective objectives, as a research team, are twofold: firstly, to build upon the foundational
research conducted in the aforementioned studies, and secondly, to cultivate a more nuanced
comprehension of how both infrastructural elements and the socio-economic milieu of
neighborhoods interplay in shaping the dynamics of affordable housing initiatives.
